# SDL_GameControllerDB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB)

A community source database of game controller mappings to be used with SDL2 Game Controller functionality.

## SDL Variants
gamecontrollerdb.txt : For games or engines using the SDL >= 2.0.6 format. This is the most recent version.

gamecontrollerdb_205.txt: For games or engines using the SDL >= 2.0.5 format. There are no range or inversion modifiers (+,-,~).

gamecontrollerdb_204.txt
For games or engines using the SDL 2.0.4 format. GUIDs are different depending on the platform. Note that SDL > 2.0.4 can still read this format.

## Create New Mappings
A mapping looks like this :
```
030000004c050000c405000000010000,PS4 Controller,a:b1,b:b2,back:b8,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:b12,leftshoulder:b4,leftstick:b10,lefttrigger:a3,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,rightstick:b11,righttrigger:a4,rightx:a2,righty:a5,start:b9,x:b0,y:b3,platform:Mac OS X,
```
It is comprised of a controller GUID (`030000004c050000c405000000010000`), a name (`PS4 Controller`), button / axis mappings (`leftshoulder:b4`) and a platform (`platform:Mac OS X`).

There are a few different tools that let you create mappings.

### [SDL2 ControllerMap](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
The controllermap utility provided with SDL2 is the official tool to create these mappings, it runs on all the platforms SDL runs (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, etc).

### [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com)
In Steam's Big Picture mode, configure your joystick. Then look in `[steam_installation_directory]/config/config.vdf` in your Steam installation directory for the `SDL_GamepadBind` entry. It is one of the last entries, it will look something like this.

```
"SDL_GamepadBind"		"030000004c050000c405000000010000,PS4 Controller,a:b1,b:b2,back:b8,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:b12,leftshoulder:b4,leftstick:b10,lefttrigger:a3,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,rightstick:b11,righttrigger:a4,rightx:a2,righty:a5,start:b9,x:b0,y:b3,"
```

Unfortunately, **Steam does not ouput the platform field**, so you will need to add it manually. At the end of the generated entry, add `platform:Windows,` or `platform:Mac OS X,` or `platform:Linux,`.


### [SDL2 Gamepad Tool](http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)
Third party cross-platform tool (Windows, macOS and Linux).

Setup your controller and copy the ouput entry. The tool currently doesn't output SDL 2.0.5 GUIDs, but that is fine as SDL still supports these GUIDs. I will convert older GUIDs in pull requests as well.

## Usage
Download gamecontrollerdb.txt, place it in your app's directory and load it.

For example :
```
SDL_GameControllerAddMappingsFromFile("gamecontrollerdb_205.txt");
```

# For Contributors
## Check Your Mappings
The currently active version is gamecontrollerdb.txt. If your mappings work on older SDL versions, you can add them to the appropriate files.
Before submitting a new Pull Request, please run the `check.py` tool to make sure everything is in order. Run it with:
```
python check.py gamecontrollerdb.txt
```

If no errors were generated you can (please) send a Pull Request! Tests are automatically run on Pull Requests, so you'll easily see if there is an issue.

### New Checks
- Tests are run to ensure a platform is present.
- Tests are run to make sure inversion and range modifiers are applied to axis fields.
- Tests are run to check for duplicates.

### Options
```
usage: check.py [-h] [--sort] [--convert_guids] [--remove_dupes]
                [--add_missing_platform]
                input_file

positional arguments:
  input_file            database file to check (gamecontrollerdb.txt)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --sort                sort the database on success
  --convert_guids       convert Windows and macOS GUIDs to the newer SDL 2.0.5
                        format
  --remove_dupes        automatically remove duplicates
  --add_missing_platform
                        adds a platform field if it is missing (on older pre
                        2.0.5 entries). Skips checks!
