# SDL_GameControllerDB

A community sourced database of game controller mappings to be used with SDL2 Game Controller functionality.

# Usage
Download gamecontrollerdb.txt, place it in your app's directory and load it.

For example :
```
SDL_GameControllerAddMappingsFromFile("gamecontrollerdb.txt");
```

The database is compatible with SDL v2.0.10 and newer. Older SDL versions are no longer supported.

## Create New Mappings
A mapping looks like this :
```
030000004c050000c405000000010000,PS4 Controller,a:b1,b:b2,back:b8,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:b12,leftshoulder:b4,leftstick:b10,lefttrigger:a3,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,rightstick:b11,righttrigger:a4,rightx:a2,righty:a5,start:b9,x:b0,y:b3,platform:Mac OS X,
```
It is comprised of a controller GUID (`030000004c050000c405000000010000`), a name (`PS4 Controller`), button / axis mappings (`leftshoulder:b4`) and a platform (`platform:Mac OS X`).

Please make sure to check that the name is a good description of the controller. If relevant, include the controller's name and model number.

## Mapping Tools
There are a few different tools that let you create mappings.

### [SDL2 Gamepad Tool](http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)
Third party cross-platform tool with GUI (Windows, macOS and Linux). Likely the easiest tool to use.

### [SDL2 ControllerMap](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
The controllermap utility provided with SDL2 is the official tool to create these mappings, it runs on all the platforms SDL runs (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, etc).

### [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com)
In Steam's Big Picture mode, configure your joystick. Then look in `[steam_installation_directory]/config/config.vdf` in your Steam installation directory for the `SDL_GamepadBind` entry. It is one of the last entries, it will look something like this.

```
"SDL_GamepadBind"		"030000004c050000c405000000010000,PS4 Controller,platform:Windows,a:b1,b:b2,back:b8,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:b12,leftshoulder:b4,leftstick:b10,lefttrigger:a3,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,rightstick:b11,righttrigger:a4,rightx:a2,righty:a5,start:b9,x:b0,y:b3,"
```

### [GNOME Games](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Games)
GNOME Games allows users to configure their own gamepads. The gamepad file the user generates is located at `~/.var/app/org.gnome.Games/config/libmanette/gamecontrollerdb` when installed from the flatpak. (GNU/Linux)
