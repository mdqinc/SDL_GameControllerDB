[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p-groarke/SDL_GameControllerDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/p-groarke/SDL_GameControllerDB)

A community source database of game controller mappings to be used with SDL2 Game Controller functionality.

#### Usage:

Download gamecontrollerdb.txt, place it in your app's directory and load with:

SDL_GameControllerAddMappingsFromFile("gamecontrollerdb.txt");
```

#### Creating new mappings:

1) Simple GUI tool to create/modify gamepad mappings: (Windows/MACOS/LINUX)

OR

2) To create new mappings, you can use the controllermap utility provided with
SDL2, or using Steam's Big Picture mode, configure your joystick and then 
look in config/config.vdf in your Steam installation directory for the 
SDL_GamepadBind entry.
